# Configuration file

A version-controlled YAML file that holds all the configuration for your project. It defines the tests, runtimes, builds, deployments, workflows, and config.

By default, the CLI will look for a velocity.yml in the current working directory. You can specify a different file with the --config flag.

TODO: Using multiple configuration files with directives in the yaml?
